# Facebook Clone Project

This is the final project from [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails) for Ruby On Rails curriculums.

## Note

- This project will only mock partial of Facebook functions to illustrate our knowledge on Ruby on Rails.
- User, Post, Comment & Like are 4 main models we are going to build in this project.
- Some advance features will be implemented to increase the complexity of this project - such as "friending, friend request, Login with Real Facebook Account, Feeding with all your posts and your friends' post"
